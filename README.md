Practical exercise for interview

Customers should be able to select products from a list and add items to a basket.
Once in the basket, they can be processed for payment through the checkout, and once completed the order is final and cannot be changed.

Items can be moved back and forth, deleted or altered between the basket and checkout stage.

Each item is bought on a subscription basis with distinct payment intervals - currently stated as Weekly, Monthly or Annually - and each have their own term length.

Things to consider....
In future it would be nice to implement a custom term length and choose between different options for payment intervals.
